title: Verified Textbook Algorithms - A Biased Survey
permalink: /
---

The paper [Verified Textbook Algorithms](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_2) by Nipkow, Eberl and Haslbeck surveys the state of the art of verifying standard textbook algorithms.
It focuses largely on the classic text by Cormen et al.
Both correctness and running time complexity are considered.

This website complements the paper and tries to give up-to-date references in the sense of a ["living review"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_review).

It must be emphasized that this survey is biased by our perspective and covers
recent work by the authors in more depth. Moreover it is inevitably incomplete.
We encourage our readers to notify us of missing related work via email or -- preferably -- a [pull request](https://github.com/maxhaslbeck/pages/pulls).

## What more is in the paper

[The paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_2) additionally summarizes programming and verification frameworks commonly used, and summarizes mathematical foundations mentioned in the early chapters of "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen et al.
