# Unverified Textbook Algorithms

This list collects textbook algorithms and basic data structures that have not yet been formally verified.
It should motivate to tackle one of those algorithms.

Feel free to add algorithms that are considered "textbook", are not yet formalized, and are missing from that list.

## List

### I - Foundations

### II - Sorting

### III - Data Structures

### IV - Advanced Design and Analysis Techniques

### V - Advanced Data Structures
- Fibonacci Heaps

### VI - Graph Algorithms

### VII - Selected Topics

### Additional Textbook Algorithms
